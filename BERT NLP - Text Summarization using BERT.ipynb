This relationship is known as the water-energy nexus.\\n(A) The energy used to drive California’s water system, including, but not limited to, the fuels used to power groundwater pumps, transportation, treatment and disposal systems for water and wastewater, heating and cooling of water in buildings and other facilities, the delivery of water, and end uses, accounts for nearly 20 percent of the total electricity usage and 30 percent of nonpower-related natural gas consumed, and there are known gaps in quantifying greenhouse gas emissions associated with that energy use.\\n(B) The water used to drive California’s energy system, including, but not limited to, the water used to turn turbines for hydropower, to produce steam and cooling systems for thermoelectric power, and to extract and refine oil and gas, represents a substantial portion of our state water demand.\\n(C) Consequently, saving water saves energy, and vice versa.\\n(D) Because the production of energy often results in the emission of greenhouse gases, there is substantial potential for emission reductions in the water system.\\n(2) While energy use has historically been a fundamental element in the planning and development of California’s water supply systems, there are new opportunities for improving this linkage to reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions. New projects that best serve water and energy investments can maximize greenhouse gas emissions reductions.\\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this act, to:\\n(1) More closely integrate the planning for water, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions.\\n(2) Enable opportunities for innovative projects and programs that reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of our water system in order to access eligible funds.\\nSEC. 2.\\nSection 39712 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\\n39712.\\n(a) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature that moneys shall be appropriated from the fund only in a manner consistent with the requirements of this chapter and Article 9.7 (commencing with Section 16428.8) of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.\\n(2) The state shall not approve allocations for a measure or program using moneys appropriated from the fund except after determining, based on the available evidence, that the use of those moneys furthers the regulatory purposes of Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) and is consistent with law. If any expenditure of moneys from the fund for any measure or project is determined by a court to be inconsistent with law, the allocations for the remaining measures or projects shall be severable and shall not be affected.\\n(b) Moneys shall be used to facilitate the achievement of reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in this state consistent with Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) and, where applicable and to the extent feasible:\\n(1) Maximize economic, environmental, and public health benefits to the state.\\n(2) Foster job creation by promoting in-state greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects carried out by California workers and businesses.\\n(3) Complement efforts to improve air quality.\\n(4) Direct investment toward the most disadvantaged communities and households in the state.\\n(5) Provide opportunities for businesses, public agencies, nonprofits, and other community institutions to participate in and benefit from statewide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\\n(6) Lessen the impacts and effects of climate change on the state’s communities, economy, and environment.\\n(c) Moneys appropriated from the fund may be allocated, consistent with subdivision (a), for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this state through investments that may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:\\n(1) Funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency, clean and renewable energy generation, distributed renewable energy generation, transmission and storage, and other related actions, including, but not limited to, at public universities, state and local public buildings, and industrial and manufacturing facilities.\\n(2) Funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the development of state‑of‑the‑art systems to move goods and freight, advanced technology vehicles and vehicle infrastructure, advanced biofuels, and low‑carbon and efficient public transportation.\\n(3) Funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with land and natural resource conservation and management, forestry, sustainable agriculture, and the water sector, including, but not limited to, water use, supply, and treatment.\\n(4) Funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through strategic planning and development of sustainable infrastructure projects, including, but not limited to, transportation and housing.\\n(5) Funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through increased in-state diversion of municipal solid waste from disposal through waste reduction, diversion, and reuse.\\n(6) Funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through investments in programs implemented by local and regional agencies, local and regional collaboratives, and nonprofit organizations coordinating with local governments.\\n(7) Funding research, development, and deployment of innovative technologies, measures, and practices related to programs and projects funded pursuant to this chapter.\\nSEC. 3.\\nSection 25229 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:\\n25229.\\n(a) The commission, in cooperation with the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Air Resources Board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water Resources, shall conduct a study of water-related energy use in California.\\n(b) In conducting the study, the commission shall do all of the following:\\n(1) Hold at least two workshops to allow input by private and public water agencies and utilities, research institutions, environmental organizations, and other interested stakeholders.\\n(2) Include any source-specific data, to be anonymized to the extent necessary to protect business confidential information or security sensitive information.\\n(3)\\nAfter considering

Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the State Air Resources Board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water Resources, shall establish a grant and loan program for water projects that result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions.\\n(b) Project categories eligible for funding under the program shall include, but need not be

The impartial analysis prepared by the legal counsel for the authority shall be subject to review and revision by the county counsel of the county that contains the largest population, as determined by the most recent federal decennial census, among those counties in which the measure will be submitted to the voters.\\n(e) Each county included in the measure shall use the exact ballot question, impartial analysis, and ballot language provided by the authority. If two or more counties included in the measure are required to prepare a translation of ballot materials into the same language other than English, the county that contains the largest population, as determined by the most recent federal decennial census, among those counties that are required to prepare a translation of ballot materials into the same language other than English shall prepare the translation and that translation shall be used by the other county or counties, as applicable.\\n(f) Notwithstanding Section 13116 of the Elections Code, if a measure proposed by the authority pursuant to this article is submitted to the voters of the authority in two or more counties, the elections officials of those counties shall mutually agree to use the same letter designation for the measure.\\n(g) The county clerk of each county shall report the results of the special election to the authority.\\n(h) (1) Notwithstanding Section 10520 of the Elections Code, for the first election at which the authority proposes a measure pursuant to subdivision (a) or (e) of Section 66704 that would generate revenues, the authority shall reimburse each county in which that measure appears on the ballot only for the incremental costs incurred by the county elections official related to submitting the measure to the voters.\\n(2) For purposes of this subdivision, “incremental costs” include all of the following:\\n(A) The cost to prepare, review, and revise the impartial analysis of the measure that is required by subdivision (d).\\n(B) The cost to prepare a translation of ballot materials into a language other than English by any county, as described in subdivision (e).\\n(C) The additional costs that exceed the costs incurred for other election races or ballot measures, if any, appearing on the same ballot in each county in which the measure appears on the ballot, including both of the following:\\n(i) The printing and mailing of ballot materials.\\n(ii) The canvass of the vote regarding the measure pursuant to Division 15 of the Elections Code.\\n(3) This subdivision is repealed on January 1, 2019.\\nSEC. 4.\\nSection 66706 of the Government Code is amended to read:\\n66706.\\nThis title shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2049, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2049, deletes or extends that date.\\nSEC. 5.\\nThe Legislature finds and declares that the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority has not assumed any existing duties from another local or state government entity and has received no state or local government revenues not counted toward another entity’s appropriations limit. Therefore, the authority has no associated appropriations limit pursuant to Article XIII B of the California Constitution as of the date of enactment of this bill.\\nSEC. 6.\\nThe Legislature finds and declares that the changes made by this act to subdivision (e) of Section 66704 of the Government Code explicitly affirm the authority of the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority to incur general obligation bonded indebtedness, so as to implement the Legislature’s intent when the statute first became operative on January 1, 2009.\\nSEC. 7.\\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.</td>\n",
              "      <td>(1) Existing law, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority Act, until January 1, 2029, establishes the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority to raise and allocate resources for the restoration, enhancement, protection, and enjoyment of wetlands and wildlife habitat in the San Francisco Bay and along its shoreline. The act establishes a governing board of the authority composed of specified members, including a member who is a resident of the San Francisco Bay area with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program, who serves as the chair. The act grants to the board all powers that are necessary to carry out the act, including, among other things, the power to levy specified benefit assessments, special taxes, and property-related fees, and to issue revenue bonds and general obligation bonds. However, the act limits the total amount of outstanding indebtedness incurred pursuant to those provisions authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds to 10% of the authority’s total revenues in the preceding fiscal year. Existing law generally requires a district to reimburse the county elections official for the actual costs incurred in conducting an election for the district. However, the act authorizes, until January 1, 2017, the authority to reimburse only the incremental costs, as defined, that are incurred by the county elections official related to submitting a special tax measure to the voters.\\nThis bill would delete the requirement that one member of the board, who serves as the chair, be a resident of the San Francisco Bay area with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program and would instead require that member to be an elected official of a bayside city or county, or an elected member of a special district, with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program. The bill would also delete the limit on the authority’s total amount of outstanding general obligation bonded indebtedness and would, instead, prohibit the authority from having a total amount of outstanding bonded indebtedness that exceeds $1,500,000,000. The bill would specify that the authority may incur general obligation bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property or for the funding or refunding of any outstanding bonded indebtness incurred by the authority. The bill would extend to January 1, 2019, the operation of the provision authorizing the authority to reimburse county elections officials for only the incremental costs of submitting a special tax measure to the voters, expanded to apply to other specified measures that would generate revenues for the authority. The bill would postpone to January 1, 2049, the repeal date for the act, and would make related conforming changes. By imposing additional duties on local government officials with regard to implementation of the act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\nThe act specifies that the special taxes are to be levied, and submitted to the voters, consistent with specified provisions of the California Constitution relating to voter approval for local tax levies and property-related fees, charges, and assessments.\\nThis bill would instead specify that measures that will generate revenues are to be submitted to the voters, consistent with those requirements of the California Constitution and the requirements of the California Constitution relating to general obligation bond indebtedness and ad valorem taxes.\\n(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\\n\\n\\nSECTION 1.\\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\\n(a)  In 1977, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that feeding livestock low doses of antibiotics from antibiotic classes that are used in human disease treatment could promote the development of antibiotic-resistance in bacteria and pose a risk to human health. The FDA, however, did not act in response to these findings, despite laws requiring the agency to do so.\\n(b)  The FDA issued voluntary guidance in December 2013 on the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics; however, this guidance is unlikely to significantly reduce the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock because of a broad exemption allowing for the use of antibiotics for disease prevention.\\n(c)  Not only do antibiotic-resistant bacteria affect the health of our society, but they also have a monetary impact. In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences noted that antibiotic-resistant bacteria generate a minimum of four to five billion dollars in costs to United States society and individuals every year. In 2009, in a study funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cook County Hospital and Alliance for Prudent Use of Antibiotics estimated that the total health care cost of antibiotic-resistant infections in the United States was between $16.6 billion and $26 billion annually. Societal costs from lost productivity due to illnesses were estimated to be an additional $35 billion.\\n(d)  In April 1999, the United States Government Accountability Office conducted a study concluding that three strains of microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses or disease in humans are resistant to antibiotics and are linked to the use of antibiotics in animals. These microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses or disease in humans are resistant to antibiotics and are linked to the use of antibiotics in animals. These microorganisms are salmonella, campylobacter, and E. Coli.\\n(e)  In 1999, 2006, and 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service conducted large-scale, voluntary surveys that revealed all of the following:\\n(1)  Eighty-four percent of grower and finisher swine farms, 83 percent of cattle feedlots, and 84 percent of sheep farms administer antimicrobials in feed or water for either health or growth promotion reasons.\\n(2)  Many of the antimicrobials that were identified were identical or closely related to drugs used in human medicine, including tetracyclines, macrolides, bactricin, penicilllins, and sulfonamides.\\n(3)  These drugs are used in people to treat serious diseases, such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, sexually transmitted infections, and skin infections; pandemics such as malaria and plague; and bioterrorism agents such as anthrax.\\n(f) In June 2002, the peer-reviewed journal, “Clinical Infectious Diseases,” published a report based on a two-year review, by experts in human and veterinary medicine, public health, microbiology, biostatistics, and risk analysis, of more than 500 scientific studies on the human health impacts of antimicrobial use in agriculture. The report recommended that antimicrobial agents should not be used in agriculture in the absence of disease and should be limited to therapy for diseased individual animals or prophylaxis when disease is documented in a herd or flock.\\n(g) In a March 2003 report, the National Academy of Sciences stated that a decrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will have little effect on the rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria and that substantial efforts must be made to decrease the inappropriate overuse of antimicrobials in animals and agriculture.\\n(h) In 2010, the peer-reviewed journal, “Molecular Cell,” published a study demonstrating that a low-dosage use of antibiotics causes a dramatic increase in genetic mutation, raising new concerns about the agricultural practice of using low-dosage antibiotics in order to stimulate growth promotion and routinely prevent disease in unhealthy conditions.\\n(i) In 2010, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration testified that the Danish ban of the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food animal production resulted in a marked reduction in antimicrobial resistance in multiple bacterial species, including Campylobacter and Enterococci.\\n(j) In 2011, the FDA found that in 2010:\\n(1) Thirteen million five hundred thousand kilograms of antibacterial drugs were sold for use on food animals in the United States.\\n(2) Three million three hundred thousand kilograms of antibacterial drugs were used for human health.\\n(3) Eighty percent of antibacterial drugs, and over 70 percent of medically important antibacterial drugs, disseminated in the United States were sold for use on food-producing animals, rather than being used for human health.\\n(k) In 2011, a review of all scientific studies on antimicrobial use in farm animals, published in Clinical Microbiology Reviews, found the following:\\n(1) That the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals leads to the development of reservoirs of antibiotic resistance, that antibiotic-resistant bacteria can spread through food, water, air, soil, and meat-industry workers, and that bacteria can share resistance genes with each other.\\n(2) A ban on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in food-producing animals would preserve the use of antibiotics for medicine.\\n(3) A Danish ban on nontherapeutic antibiotics in food-producing animals resulted in little change in animal morbidity and mortality, and only a modest increase in production cost.\\n(l) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded in a recent report, “Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013,” that overuse or misuse of antibiotics contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, whether in human medicine or in agriculture. The CDC estimated that antibiotic resistance causes at least 23,000 deaths and two million illnesses every year.\\n(m) In 2013, the peer-reviewed journal, “The Journal of the American Medical Association,” published a study showing higher levels of antibiotic-resistant skin and soft-tissue infections in people living in proximity to hog farms or fields treated with swine manure in Pennsylvania. Similarly, in 2014, the peer-reviewed journal, “Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology,” published a study focused on hospitalized veterans in rural areas of Iowa, finding that people living in close proximity to a swine-feeding operation were nearly three times as likely to have been affected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at the time of admission to the hospital.\\n(n) The FDA’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System routinely finds that retail meat products are contaminated with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics that are important to human medicine.\\n(o) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, “the largest nonhuman use of antimicrobial agents is in food-producing animal production, and most of this is in healthy animals to increase growth or prevent diseases. Evidence now exists that these uses of antimicrobial agents in food-producing animals have a direct negative impact on human health and multiple impacts on the selection and dissemination of resistance genes in animals and the environment. Children are at increased risk of acquiring many of these infections with resistant bacteria and are at great risk of severe complications if they become infected.”\\n(p) Many scientific studies confirm that the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in people.\\n(q) The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a risk to the health of Californians and reduced use of antibiotics for livestock production is likely to reduce the risks of the rise and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through food and other pathways, thus reducing the risk to Californians.\\nSEC. 2.\\nIt is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would address the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production.</td>\n",

Consequently, some people have been arbitrarily subjected to unnecessary strip and body cavity searches after arrests for minor misdemeanor and infraction offenses. Some present search practices violate state and federal constitutional rights to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.\\n(2) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the people of California by establishing a statewide policy strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches.\\n(b) The provisions of this section shall apply only to prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses and to any minor detained prior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or she is a person described in Section 300, 601, or 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code alleged to have committed a misdemeanor or infraction offense. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a person in the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Director of the Division of Juvenile Justice in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\\n(c) As used in this section the following definitions shall apply:\\n(1) “Body cavity” only means the stomach or rectal cavity of a person, and vagina of a female person.\\n(2) “Physical body cavity search” means physical intrusion into a body cavity for the purpose of discovering any object concealed in the body cavity.\\n(3) “Strip search” means a search which requires a person to remove or arrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the underclothing, breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of such person.\\n(4) “Visual body cavity search” means visual inspection of a body cavity.\\n(d) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, including Section 40304.5 of the Vehicle Code, if a person is arrested and taken into custody, that person may be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, body scanners, and thorough clothing searches in order to discover and retrieve concealed weapons and contraband substances prior to being placed in a booking cell.\\n(2) An agency that utilizes a body scanner pursuant to this subdivision shall endeavor to avoid knowingly using a body scanner to scan a woman who is pregnant.\\n(e) A person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or infraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, or a minor detained prior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or she is a person described in Section 300, 601, or 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, except for those minors alleged to have committed felonies or offenses involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, shall not be subjected to a strip search or visual body cavity search prior to placement in the general jail population, unless a peace officer has determined there is reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulable facts, to believe that person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a strip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or contraband. A strip search or visual body cavity search, or both, shall not be conducted without the prior written authorization of the supervising officer on duty. The authorization shall include the specific and articulable facts and circumstances upon which the reasonable suspicion determination was made by the supervisor.\\n(f) (1) Except pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2), a person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or infraction offense not involving weapons, controlled substances, or violence, shall not be confined in the general jail population unless all of the following are true:\\n(A) The person is not cited and released.\\n(B) The person is not released on his or her own recognizance pursuant to Article 9 (commencing with Section 1318) of Chapter 1 of Title 10 of Part 2.\\n(C) The person is not able to post bail within a reasonable time, not less than three hours.\\n(2) A person shall not be housed in the general jail population prior to release pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) unless a documented emergency exists and there is no reasonable alternative to that placement.
